#Check the datatype of AP dataset
class(AP)

#Explore the dataset AP
start(AP) #Start of the time series(1949)
end(AP)   #End of the time series(1960)
frequency(AP) #Interval of this time series is 12months in a year
summary(AP)   #No of passengers are distributed across the spectrum
time(AP)

#Fitting the regression line of no of passengers and time
#As time is the dependent variable in Time series analysis

#Plotting the time series dataset AirPassengers

#Fit the Regression line (Gives mean of time series analysis)

#Analysis of Timeseries data
cycle(AP)#Print cycle across years
aggregate(AP)
plot(aggregate(AP))

#Check the Seasonality part
#Box plot across months give a sense of seasonal effect
boxplot(AP~cycle(AP))
#Conclusion from boxplot:
#Number of passengers in the month of july and august are more(seasonality)


#Check the trend of AP time series dataset

plot(AP)
#Conclusion:
#The time series not stationary(mean is increasing,variance is not equal)
#Before test the stationary data we have to make the data to stationary
#First:Remove the unequal variances by taking log function
#Second:(Trend component)to make the mean constant,differentiate the series 
plot(log(AP))      #Make the variance equal
plot(diff(log(AP)))#Make the mean as constant

#Now the series is stationary so we can use any kind of time series modelling
#ARIMA Model or Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test

#p  d  q
#We are going to get p,d,q values from the  autocorelation graph
#Autocorelation 
acf(AP)
#Clearly the values are exceeding the blue line in the figure
#So our aim is to reduce that lines below the blue line
acf(diff(log(AP))) #Determination of q (q=1,1st line is the just before line 
                   #of inverted line)
#partial autocorrelation
pacf(diff(log(AP))) #Determination of p (p=0,0th line is the just before line 
                    #of inverted line)

#Finally we get (p,d,q)=(0,1,1) for our ARIMA Model
